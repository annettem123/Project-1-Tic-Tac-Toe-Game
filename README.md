Planning Steps and story about development process and problem-solving strategy:

Prepare for Stand Ups:

1. What have you done?
created a new repo in git hub
forked and cloned code from new repo in git hub to Projects Directory
created new files index.html, styles.css, script.js, and README.md inside of Projects Directory
review my past notes and documentation from lessons

completed logic for playing the game
render a game board in the browser
switch turns between X and O
include separate HTML / CSS / Javascript files
stick with KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
deploy your game online 
use semantic markup for HTML and CSS
have well-format and well-commented code

2. What will you do today?

create wireframe
create user stories
write some pseudocode
in HTML, create 9 divs
in JS, work on logic 
review digital games (player 1 player 2)
review lessons of code to determine which are applicable
add some styling and link styles.css to index.html
add some JS and link script.js to index.html

3. What barriers might you encounter today?

using the right code and syntax

if stuck: 1) google; 2) post ? on slack or ask another student; 3) create an issue and ask instructor

4. How close to MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?

   80% complete

5. Unsolved Problems which would be fixed in future iterations:

    Show a draw if neither player wins

    Display which side won or show a draw if neither player wins
