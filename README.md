Planning Steps and story about development process and problem-solving strategy:

Prepare for Stand Ups:

1. What have you done?
created a new repo in git hub
forked and cloned code from new repo in git hub to Projects Directory
created new files index.html, styles.css, script.js, and README.md inside of Projects Directory
review my past notes and documentation from lessons 

2. What will you do today?

create wireframe
create user stories
write some pseudocode
in HTML, create 9 divs
in JS, work on logic 
review digital games (player 1 player 2)
review lessons of code to determine which are applicable
add some styling and link styles.css to index.html
add some JS and link script.js to index.html

3. What barriers might you encounter today?

using the right code and syntax

if stuck: 1) google; 2) post ? on slack or ask another student; 3) create an issue and ask instructor

4. How close to MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?

5. Unsolved Problems which would be fixed in future iterations:

    Show a draw if neither player wins
